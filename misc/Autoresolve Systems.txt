Since there will be so much territory to support, so many agents and factions going on, a competent and enjoyable autoresolve for 
combat and events will be neccessary.
The players won't want to handle every mission by hand, after all.

Systems to investigate:

**Combat**
A list of each participating faction will be present.
Autoresolve will progress one 'round' at a time.
Each entry in the list will choose a target at random per attack they would get.
A line is drawn from their entry to the entries they attack that round(Plural support needed due to speed heroes)
An attack then rolls to-hits and dodges, then reduction is counted, then outer health 
is affected(energy shields), then inner health is affected(limb health)
If a limb hits 0 health or below, there's a random chance of it being disabled, mangled, or destroyed, requiring various medicals to heal.

This repeats until only one faction(or pool of allied factions) remains.

An agent can be set to 'healer' in their orders menu outside of conflict.
Healers will spend their rounds healing a random ally instead.
If there are no eligible targets to be healed, they will attack instead.

Choosing the autoresolve will have a menu like such
>Autoresolve<
>Quiet/Loud< 
>Lethal/Non-Lethal<
Quiet is only available if you're the initatior, and allows free hits until you're detected, however comes with
 the penalty of a loss of half a round for all agents once detected. (This one will likely change)
Lethal/Non-Lethal governs the type of attacks your agents will do. Non-Lethal strikes are slightly less accurate, and less damaging. 
(Unless traits or equipment designed for such is present)
