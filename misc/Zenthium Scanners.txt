Territory Thing
Allow constructing of genetic scanners upon entry, and around the city. The population with secrecy personalities will be 
unhappy about this, and discouraged to move in, and encouraged to move out.

Genetic Scanners
Reveals the genome type of people. (Normal, Mutant, Super, ect) 
They can skip it they desire with secrecy personality, and high enough stealth skill.
Failing the stealth skill will put a warrent on them for tresspassing.
