In an effort to discourage players from dumping all their power into one unit, a hot topic among the 
world and it's factions it the GPR(Global Power Ranking)

Agents in the top 100 are world famous, and can be recognized on the streets, and are often targeted by small 
scale crimes like robbery, kidnapping, and family-hostages.

Agents in the top 10, everyone knows about, and are often targeted by large scale crimes, or even whole factions.




As agents perform actions in the world, survivors will attribute what they've seen to the GPR.
If an agent performs any action other than walking/scouting, they will be attributed to the GPR by everyone not within their faction.
Secretive Agents can take advantage of stealth and subterfuge tactics while on the field to avoid being seen...
While Psychopathic Agents can simply ensure there are no surviving witnesses.

Players can choose to attribute members from their faction directly to the GPR, mostly for fun and challenge.


This can play well into secret identities too, an agent dons a mask(or other form of identity hiding) and all actions while in disguise
will be attributed to the masked identity instead, and thus be less likely to be targeted.
However, if anyone outside of your faction see's the identity swap, they will link the identities in the GPR, but only by a small percent.

New Mechanic? Identities, People will attribute identities to the masked agent, espionage, hacking, or divining can be done to increase
various identities towards the masked agent.
This can be weaponized as well, if you have three suspected individuals of a top 10, you could spread propoganda of an agent you don't
like, and they will take all the offensive flack that comes with it.
