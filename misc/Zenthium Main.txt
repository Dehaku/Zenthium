Super Heroes, Villians, Mutants, Aliens and Organizations compete for territory around the world.

Factions consist of members from the various pools of people.

*Entities*
Normies(80% population)
-Normal people, Simple skills and attributes, nothing noteworthy aside from abundance.
-These people fill a vast majority of factions ranks, as engineers, scientists, diplomats, and constructors.

Mutants(10% population)
-People who have extrodinary physical qualities based on their own bodies.

Mystics(8% population)
-Individuals who practice arcane and otherworldly arts, or are infused with them.
-E.g. Witches, Vampires.

Supers(1% population)
-Individuals who have unexplainable and usually epic powers and capabilities.

Aliens(1% population, "friendly" to earth)
-Various Individuals from another planet or dimension entirely. Most are completely hostile. 
-Many different sects of aliens, very few get along with eachother.




Turn based combat

*Territorial overworld*
-Factions compete for territory, intelligence, and resources.

-Territory
By occupying pre-defined regions, a faction will gain resources over time.
Regions are pre-defined blobs of land or water.
Land is available right from the start.
Water regions while visible, require tech to construct floating or underwater buildings, Ooo that'd be good for an expansion. Water terrian, vehicles, merfolk population, and tech!




-Resources
Currency; Zenthium, a form of super matter that can amp supers and equipment.
All resources can be purchased from a global market, however their stock is limited.
Stock is gained by factions selling resources from their territories for Zenthium.
By controlling all of one source of a resource, a faction can effectively choke out others by refusing to sell.






*Entity Management*
Your people have powers, agendas and ethics of their own, and build relationships on the way.
As your people work together, they grow to love or hate one another, having effects in the field.
Friends gain defensive bonuses or allied actions.
Rivals and Enemies gain damage buffs while on the field.

Relations will change either randomly and manipulated by management, or affected by agendas while on the field.
Like heroes who do not allow killing will grow to rival people who get kills.
(Traits based? Kleptomania trait, automatically loots enemies for themselves, pisses off most other people)

-Death
When an entity dies, all allied units will gain various buffs and debuffs based on the relationship.
A friend will lose defense/accuracy but gain damage.
A rival will gain speed and movement, but lose damage.
If the friend is infused with Zenthium, they may sacrifice their soul and become unrevivable by any means, to infuse their friend with 10x the zenthium content they possessed.


*Combat mechanics*

Charge
-Push enemies
-Through walls
-Push enemies through walls

Pickup and Throw
-Enviromental objects as Projectiles or Shields
-Enemies, at enemies or walls
-Allies, Thrown as movement (Ala Disgaea)

Counterattack
-Chance to immediately gain an action during or after being attacked or other special events


*Powers*
Too easy, not worth focusing on.
However; Most supers will only have one power/ect. Though there wil lbe small odds to have more, and
increasingly lower odds to have more ontop of that.







*Roster*
Your global team will be filled with normals and supers.
Normals can be brought onto the field, which can still be viable. Supers can be brought down, if played smart,
or simply providing good support for your own supers.



*Equipment*
Weapons, Armor and Gadgets can be bought, taken, or researched and developed.
For 'supers' who are more powerless but gadget based(Ala Tony Stark), they can produce equipment for others
but gain significant bonuses when using their own equipment. 2x or even 4x benefits.







*How turns work*
While turnbased, combat is also 'round' based, however 'turns' are not limited by the rounds.
A round is a vague unit of time which the world goes by, and a turn is an action an individual may take.
While someone really fast may have 3 'turns' in a 'round', their status effects only tick once per round.

Example; Hero has enough speed to gain 5 turns per round, has 2 health regeneration, and is poisoned by 5.
This hero may act five times without his health being modified, after which the round catches up, and he
takes 3 damage.

Turn order is determined by a units Speed attribute, the more speed, the more turns you get.
Speed is directly counted against the round.
Example: Hero; 50 speed, Villian; 75 Speed.
Round 1(Each round is 100 ticks)
50 ticks in, Hero's up; Acts
75 ticks in, Villian's up; Acts
100 ticks in; Hero's up; Acts(50 speed, so acts every 50 ticks.)
Round 2(The speed ticks are still counted, villian needs 50 more ticks)
150 ticks in, Both Hero and Villian are up, Hero Acts(Hero has higher speed), Villian Acts;
200 ticks in, Hero's up; Acts
Round 3(Ect. Villian's next turn is at tick 225)





*Combat Stats and Effects*
Health Points; How much damage they can take before dropping, This alters their speed and damage as it lowers, capped at 50%.
Stamina; How many actions can be taken before wearing down, Regenerates slowly as less intense actions are taken.
Pain; How much punishment they can take at once before taking severe penalties.
Will; How stable and compliant to your commands they are.

Speed; Rate of turn growth
Movement; How far they can move in one turn
Dodge; Chance to avoid taking damage
Defense(Type); How much damage is removed from an attack, ****Can crit to stun attacker****
Absorb-For-Health(Type); How much damage is absorbed and turned into healing for the next round.
Absorb-For-Damage(Type); How much damage is absorbed and turned into damage for the next round.
Regeneration; How much health is gained per round.





*Vision*
While it would take too much to have a proper combat zone with multiple floors, we can emulate elevation for
variety and strategy.
The field will be flat 2d image, but each tile will have it's own 'elevation', Mostly for outdoor maps.
Ground level is 0, half a person up would be 5, a full person would be 10, contining up.
Same for negatives and down.
Vision would be obscured and treated as a wall at 10 difference of current standing.
Cover could use this same formula. 5 variance being half cover, 10 and beyond being full.




*Multiplayer* (Not doing, maybe in sequel)
The world map's time will only progress while all player entities have ticked a 'Allow Time Progress' box.
All players can uncheck it at any time to stop the progress, for managing things.
Any active battles automatically lock and untick their 'Allow Time Progress' box.
When a battle occurs, it will be added to the 'Battle' tab, which will list all currently active battles.
All players can then select and play(if involved) or watch(if waiting for time to progress).

Battles will have a one hour(in game) prep time which allows other players groups to join in if nearby, allowing
 multiple player ambushes.



*Combat Display*
Attacks, Melee attacks will have the attacking entity 'slide' towards the target, then back, over one second.
Attacks, Range will spawn a colored beam, fading over one second.
Attacks will cause all affected tiles to glow white for one second.
This allows melee to act like a 'sweep', or ranged piercing attacks to show their areas.



*Science, Research, Development*
There are 3 main fields of progress.
Science - Gathering of new information.
Research - Improving already existing information.
Development - Using the information.

-Science
Science is performed to gain new information, and fields of research and development.
By performing science, you can unlock new items, materials, and experiments(Gene, Mystic, and Beyond).

-Research
Research is performed to improve already existing items, materials, attributes, and other qualities.
By performing research, you can make armor soak more damage, weigh less, become cheaper to produce, and more.
This also applies to weapons, buildings, and all other developed equipment, even training speeds and effectiveness.

-Development
Development is performed to construct buildings, items, and even conduct training on individuals.




*Training*
Individuals do not level up, randomly gain stats, or abilities.(Unless choosing a specific setting)
Instead, Individuals progress by training, which is accomplished by being assigned to a training facility at a base.
Once sent to a training facility, they begin spending time on the specific attribute or quality, and randomly
 gaining progress towards gaining a 'point' or ability.
The factors involved are...
-Time, How long until the following factors are checked and applied.
-Gain Chance, The chance of gaining progress towards 'completing' the training.
-Gain Amount, The amount of progress gained.
All of the above factors can be improved by Research, or simply the Individuals own stats/powers.

Training also causes fatique, draining their max stamina temporarily.
The Individual's attributes can make them more resistent to fatique, allowing longer training periods.


*Ethics*
Each individual will have a handful of Ethics that govern how they interact with people and the world.
Ethics spring up in many ways, either on the battlefield, influencing how their team views them, or on
the overworld, influencing all members of their team over time.

Factions also have their own set of ethics, though this is more loose and dynamic.
The three most abundant ethics of a factions roster will determine what ethics the faction follows.
Members of a faction will then act as if they have those ethics while they are with the faction.
Faction ethics influence members at a vastly lower amount than personal ethics.
Thus conflicting ethics of a faction and it's members will make them quite unhappy over time.
Example; Faction Ethic: Lone Wolf, Member Ethic: Group Effort.
The faction prefers to be distant from eachother on the battlefield, where as the member likes to be as close as possible.
The member ethic is vastly stronger than the faction ethic, netting a loss.

*Happiness*
Happiness is important for individuals. An unhappy individual will leave their faction, taking with them what 
they've learned and can carry.
Happiness goes up with luxury resources, positive relationships, and success.
Happiness goes down with a lack of vital resources, more negative relationships than positives, and failing.
A high happiness also grants faster training times.


=======Content=======
This section is to be filled with fluff, and more specific ideas of what should be included with the various mechanics.


==Static Factions==
=These are factions that will always be generated with a new game, their tech levels and roster will vary, but 
=their goals will stay the same.

--The Third Eye
-Purity through force
These individuals practice and live by the mystic ways, fighting to clense the world of unchecked arcane and exotic
threats.
-Population; Mostly Mystics, though other entities are welcomed to join their groups as long as they value clensing.
-Agenda; They live and grow like anyone else, however their days are spent tracking and dealing with mystics that
refuse to live peacefully among the world.
Specifically, They tend to hunt vampires, witches, werewolves, and liches that are not aligned with themselves or
allied factions.
-Relations; They tend to be friendly to factions unless they house Mystics of their own, which causes negative reactions
on their end.
They're often called out on this paradox when meeting new factions.


--The One
-The hive knows all
This... individual is composed of many entities, all infected by it's unknown taint. All members share the same thoughts
and memories instantly. Making any attempts of hostility against it impossible to hide.
-Population; Anything organic. The One's members are able to infect unconscious beings within seconds, absorbing their
minds into the collective.
-Agenda; As terrifying and threatening as this... It seems relatively peaceful. Thankfully it doesn't care 
for Science and R&D at all, instead attempting to takeover as much free territory as possible.
However, factions eventually tend to strike against The One, at which point they are met with the full force, and
usually become absorbed into it.
This is how The One progresses in fields.
-Relations; Friendly to any faction, Allies with no one. Never strikes first, and usually gives a second chance.


--The Government
-What the people say, and do, are never the same.
These individuals attempt to collect the world to join them, following under one system of law and order.
In the public eye, they keep order and rule with a strict code of ethics.
In private... They work with Blind Justice.
-Population; Any law abiding individual. Lawbreakers are cast out or moved to Blind Justice.
-Agenda; The world's government focuses to peacefully acquire relations with factions to cause them to follow
their code of ethics.
They advance peacefully while keeping eyes on everyone.
-Relations; Peaceful to those who follow their code of ethics, unfriendly with those who employ criminals.


--Blind Justice
-The law cannot punish what it can't see.
This secret organization of The Government collects unruley and potent individuals to influence and appropriate 
other factions. 
All in the name of Justice... and greed.
-Population; Anyone, Usually paid very well, or held against their will.
-Agenda; The secret military of the Government. 


--The Dredge
-You got it? We want it.
These... visitors from another world are a nasty collective of alien species.
Scavengers, Loots, Raiders... Barbarians.
They invade and they take everything they can. For what? Who knows. They certainly have more than enough tech of 
their own.
-Population; Aliens only.
Agenda; They raid 
Relations; Hostile to everyone.

--The Living("Friendly" graverobbing Undead)
-"Zenthium has given us immortality, even after death"
This collective has taken the "gift" of zenthium to the extreme, and used it to gain an undead immortality.
-Population; High ratio of Mystics
Agenda; Growing their numbers from graveyards via specialized missions in other faction's territory and recruiting
members with promises of safety and healing from fatal diseases and injuries.
They don't have much desire outside of growing their numbers, though due to the concentraiton of mystics, secretism and
a lust for rituals is common









====Ethics====
Lone Wolf: Dislikes people as they're close to them.
Group Effort: Prefers to be close to allies.
Kleptomaniac: Steals loot for themselve, preventing you from having access to it. Negative relations with others on team.
Friendly: Generally higher standing than most.
Secrecy: Dislikes those who share knowledge outside of allies/friends.
