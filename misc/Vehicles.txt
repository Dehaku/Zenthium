Vehicles consist of Motorcycles, Cars/Trucks, Tanks, Mechas, Helicopter/Planes.
Vehicles are constructed in Garage buildings and can be assigned to agents for overworld and battlemap use.



On the overworld, Vehicles have their own speed, almost always faster than the agent's normal speed, allowing greater travel.
Squads of agents can benefit from the vehicles speed if there's enough passenger slots. 
All squad vehicles are talleyed, and travel at the slowest speed. If there's not enough passenger slots for everyone, this speed is on-foot travel speed.

On the battlemap, Vehicles take up at least 1 to 10 radius of tiles, can move any direction freely(For simplicity, turning doesn't matter),
and if it's weight and strength is high enough, can smash through terrian with ease.
