*==Attributes==*
An agent's base capabilities are made of the following stats.

*Sum Cap
*+Speed
*+Strength
*+Agility
*+Endurance
*+Charisma
*+Intelligence
(*, Can be raised)
(+, Can be taught)

While attributes can be trained higher, they are limited.
An agent has a maximum attribute sum cap that their attributes can be raised to.
Example
Sum Cap 30
Speed 20, 10 strength, all others are 0. No more attribute gains can be acquired.
Speed 5, Strength 5, Agility 5, Endurance 5, Charisma 5, Intelligence 5, Sum of 30.
The Sum Cap can be raised, but is far more difficult to raise than the base attributes.
Talents, Races, and powers can modify the sum cap as well.
