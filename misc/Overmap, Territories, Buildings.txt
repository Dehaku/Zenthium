The worldmap is split up into various randomly shaped territories.
The territory borders are static, but they contain buildable tiles within.
Each tile can support one building.

Territories contain these aspects
-Static borders
-1 to 3 static resources
-Building slots
-Scaling values such as; Safety-/-Dangerous, Poor-/-Luxurious, Anger-/-Happiness

As events happen within a territory, how they are resolved affects the Safety/Dangerous slider.
General population will pay attention to this before entering the territory.
Weak/Low ambition population will desire safety territories to relax in.
Aggressive/Helpful population will desire dangerous territories to assist in the warzones.


-Building Slots
Various buildings can be made to aid your faction, but the general population won't care for most.
A slot can be leased to the general population for a small Zenny income.
They will build various stores and hotels that will increase your poor/luxurious slider, attracting more general 
population and increasing the pool you can recruit from, as well as your passive Zenny income.

If an event occurs on a building slot, The building will be made Unproductive until resolved.
If resolved in a particularly destructive or undesired way, like failing to engage, failing the engagement, ect... The building
will become damaged, and require repairs.
Leased buildings can be assigned agents for repairs, speeding up the process and raising Happiness in the territory.
Some agents may enjoy this if they are particularly benevolent.
