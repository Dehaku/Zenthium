Factions tend to inherit a group ethic or agenda, a few possabilities are...

*Well that's just Super
Super's are banding together to rule over the other factions.
Normies, Mutants, None of them are fit to govern or rule.
What happens to them is decided by the general ethics of the super's faction.

*Technology is a sin
Electricity comes in big bolts from the sky, not handheld devices.
The only path to take is one you can handle with your own mind, body, 
and spirit... and maybe a handful of powers too.


*Whatever works
This faction may seem to have no moral compass at first, but they simply will do /anything/ that advances them.
Good, Evil, it matters not, so long as they grow bigger, and stronger.

*Woodstock
Metals and Alloys are a crutch, and the process harms the planet, grow with nature, not against.
These simple people are not anti-technology, they simply believe one should use what evolves, not what is stagnant.
