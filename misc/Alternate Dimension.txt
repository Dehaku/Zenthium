10:48 PM - Savarin: ... would a
10:48 PM - Savarin: 'Zenthium Titan'
10:49 PM - Dehaku: mmmm?
10:49 PM - Savarin: Would that be like
10:49 PM - Savarin: An endgame kaiju?
10:49 PM - Dehaku: Oh definitely. I could see that as a doomsday level event.
10:49 PM - Dehaku: Big ol' token on the overmap going from region to region, wiping them out.
10:50 PM - Dehaku: Probably spawned either by...
10:50 PM - Dehaku: 1 in 1 million chance during normal random events...
10:50 PM - Dehaku: Or perhaps as a long term ritual/project by factions.
10:50 PM - Dehaku: Think... Evil cultists gathering mutants and supers for years.
10:51 PM - Dehaku: The lore is loose as hell currently, but the intention is that Zenthium is from an "Alternate dimension"
10:52 PM - Dehaku: So, pulling a Zenthium Titan would likely be a mystic apocolyptic ritual.
10:52 PM - Savarin: oo
10:52 PM - Savarin: Good way to justify "magic" and "technology"
10:52 PM - Dehaku: Ye.
10:52 PM - Dehaku: Also, tangentally related...
10:52 PM - Dehaku: I figured out a few expansion packs if this all becomes a success.
10:53 PM - Dehaku: -Water! 
Water terrian, vehicles, merfolk population, and tech!
Underwater and Floating buildings for water regions.
Under and On water battle maps
Technology for submersive armor, floating or submersive vehicles, and new resource growing methods, like seaweed for food, or algae for fuels.
Merfolk population pool. Inline with Mutants or perhaps even being all added into mutants... Mermaids, Crabpeople, Sharks with freakkin laser beams.
Traits for the new population; Gills for breath, Fins for added speed in and under water.
10:53 PM - Dehaku: I'd likely asset swap that one WITH an "Alternate Dimension" version...
10:53 PM - Dehaku: Alternate Dimension being uber late game content.
10:53 PM - Dehaku: Water and Alternate DImension would go into the same expansion, due to extremely similar content.
10:53 PM - Dehaku: And another expansion solely for Space focus.
10:54 PM - Dehaku: It gets it's own due to easily unique mechanics.
10:54 PM - Dehaku: So, in line with Zenthium Titans...
10:54 PM - Dehaku: When you start moving into the Alternate Dimension...
10:54 PM - Dehaku: Wouldn't be surprising to see those roaming the overworld naturally. :P
