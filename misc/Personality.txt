Personality is consisted of various sliders. Individuals will favor those who lean closer to their views.

Bright <-> Brooding
Calm <-> Excitable
Greedy <-> Generous?
Cruel <-> Merciful
Caring <-> Aloof
Crude <-> Elegant
Secrecy <-> Openness
Simple <-> Exotic


*Satisfaction*
Each of these sliders has 'satisfied' bar that gradually creeps towards 0. Ranging from -100 to 100.
The mood of the agent is effected by how satisfied all these bars are.
Default of 0 means they are bored and unfulfilled, and may more readily seek actions that will satisfy their personality.
Overall negative will put them in a bad mood, and may lash out in unpleasant manners. They will constantly seek actions to satisfy
their personality.
Each event they witness that raises or lowers a personality need is remembered, with a slow decay.
If a faction commits a cruel action to them while they are merciful, they will have a massive negative relation
with that faction. The value gradually decaying over time.
If a friendly agent commits a Bright act to a Bright agent, the friendly agent will have a positive relation with that agent that
will gradually decay over time.

*Relations*
Conversations and Relations will be effected by the personality.
Agent A is Calm and Brooding
Agent B is Calm and Bright
Agent A speaks with Agent B, using Calm personality subtext. Assuming the subject isn't a conflict, they 
will both like eachother more since they share the same personality aspect.
(Increased odds of success, rather than outright success)

Agent B speaks with Agent A, using Brooding subtext. Agent A is on the opposite end of this scale, and thus thinks less of
Agent B.
(Again, odds, not exact outright.)
