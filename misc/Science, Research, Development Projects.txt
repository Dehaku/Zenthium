S,R,D.
-Science provides new fields of thought and concepts, in short, unlocking new things.
--Unlocking guns, solar power, flight, ect.
-Research allows improving upon existing technologies and concepts.
--Making weapons deal more damage, training more effective, zenthium mining effiency, ect.
-Development governs the construction and manufactoring of buildings, gear, and other products.
--???, Probably governs solidifying milestones from research to produce prototypes, and gradually makes milestone projects cheaper.
--Affects final percentages of stats, making them even better. Also affects item cost

Milestone: While research can constantly improve something, it cannot be constructed until the current research is turned into a template for construction, called a milestone.
So if you had a gun with 20 damage and researched it's damage to 23, you cannot produce the gun until you turn it into a new milestone.
Short example, Machine Pistol Mk II(10 dam, 10 acc, 10 lbs), producable. Accuracy is researched up to 16, but Mk II is still 10.
So you produce a new milestone with the stats, so you now have Machine Pistol Mk III(10 dam, 16 acc, 10 lbs).
You still have Mk II's in your inventory, with only 10 acc. But now you can also produce Mk III, whic hahs 16 acc.





*====Projects====*

*==Science
*-Internet
-Allows territories to link their computational resources, as well as increasing communication possabilities.
-Better communication, faster support times, like air support attacks, orbital drops, ect.
*-Orbit
-Prequisite for various technologies
*-Thruster
-Extremely fast, but heavy, hot, and fuel hungry propulsion
*-Flight
-Allows constructing vehicles and gear that can fly
*-Computers
-Enhances research speeds, and machine accuracy.
*-Neural Interface
-Allows meshing agents with machinery
*-Neural Harddrive
-Allows instantly downloading archived information
-Instantly trains an agent's levels up to what has been stored.
*-Night-Night
-Allows refinement of special herbs into knock out poisons
*-All Nighty-Night Long
-Allows knock out poison refinement into a progressively stronger version upon movement per round.(Standing still will leave basic poison potency, each round moved doubles the previous potency, for knocking out faster/bigger targets)
*-Acupuncture
-A form of long term healing, enhancable with zenthium for supers
*-3d Printing Gun
-Allows guns to fire multiple types of ammo on the same magazine, modifies the bullet in the chamber. Slows fire rate.
Gravity Manip
Low; Training Center, Mid, Vehicles, High; Space speedups
*-Self Matter Manipulator
-Allows devices and stations to automatically upgrade to latest model when within their own faction territory.
-Example: Advanced rifle is made obsolete by enhanced damage research, when brought within the territory, it automatically 'downloads' and upgrades itself to the new model with enhanced damage.



*-Recon Sattelite
Each recon satellite launched into orbit can then be used to grant vision on a battlefield, cooldowns dependent on technology, generally 1 week to start with.
Can be upgraded to thermal to allow vision in buildings
Buildings can be upgraded for thermal resistence
